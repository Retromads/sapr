### Learning and research
>[Google](https://www.google.com) it! Obvious yes, but always nice to be reminded. It would be irresponsible to recommend google without mentioning that their payment model is to collect information about its users and sell services based on this. Google is not free, you are paying them with your privacy instead of money.

>[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) it? More privacy friendly alternative to Google, give it a try if you wish

>[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com) is also obvious but still deserves a mention always and forever.

>[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) offers video versions of real university courses, most of it free with optional paid certificate.

>[StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/sites) and its subsites such as Stack Overflow has millions of questions with detailed answers. Usually you'll find your way here through googling a problem but also a good place to ask for help if you can't find an answer. Just remember to read the guidelines. Remember to take answers with a grain of salt and take author reputation and answer votes into account.

### Your privacy
Our internet rights and privacy is under constant siege, this section is dedicated to means to protect your privacy from third parties. 

#### Quick glossary
VPNs and proxies are both means to hide your IP address, quick summary:
>[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) - Virtual private network, masks your IP address throughout all your web applications. Generally safer than using a proxy.

>[Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) is by definition _a person authorized to act on behalf of another_ and so a _proxy server_ is a server that acts on behalf of your computer thus masking its IP address. Only works on a per application basis, is considered less safe than using a VPN.

>[Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)) should also be mentioned which in addition to offering free IP masking also grants access to services that are usually unavailable like .onion websites (some people call it _the weeb web_). Tends to be a lot slower than the other alternatives.

Other important concepts:

>[Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) is the process of rendering data scrambled to prevent third parties from understanding it.

>[IP Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) 

#### How the internet sees you
On your home network you probably have several devices connected most of the time, like mobile phones and laptops (wifi), printers and desktop computers (wifi or cabled), and / or other smart devices. Each of these devices are assigned a unique address (IP address) on your home network, but when accessing the external web all devices on your home network usually use the same address. As the name implies the IP address provides a way for one computer to find another among billions of computers. IP address / computer relationship is not a permanent one, and one computer may have several IP addresses for example if it is connected to more than one network. Your external IP address (from your home to the internet) may change at any time unless your provider is serving you a static IP address. So when you surf around online, your IP address can be traced back to your home network but not to you as an individual. So because the external IP address represents the whole home network, that IP address does not represent any one individual person, or computer. 

Every webservice that is accessed from a device on your home network can see your IP address. Technically only your internet service provider (ISP) knows the connection between you and your IP address (or whoever pays for your subscription), but facebook and google probably also knows. Most websites that run ads have ads through google, and most popular websites also have a facebook "like" button on every article posted. Both the google ads and the facebook _like_ button requires contacting their servers, and so google and / or facebook will log your IP address and website visited. Since you most likely have accounts at one of these or both they already have an IP / name link, possibly more if your home network houses more people. If you are logged in to either google or facebook when surfing the web then they will actually recieve more information than your ISP, since they have can connect your website visits to your name and not just IP address.

This is one example of how data about you is collected and sold and also one good reason to why you'd want to mask your IP address. But it also gives a good example of a case where a VPN or proxy wouldn't protect your privacy. It doesn't matter if you hide your IP address if you expose yourself through other means, like being logged into facebook or google, or any account linked to your real identity. It is important if you want to protect your privacy to also think about your habits online. Online privacy isn't only about hiding who you are online or hiding criminal activity, it's about choosing for yourself what you want to share and who you want to share it with.



#### Tips

## Software resources

### Online resources

>[Lynda](https://www.lynda.com) monthly 20 $ subscription access to high quality courses in several different topics



### Books

### Tools
>[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system, there are others like it but Git is the most widely used at the moment. Long story short it enables collaberation in software development and saves changes you make in the code as checkpoints (kind of) so that you can rewind your code to an earlier state if you wish. Git is mandatory for most serious software developers to master, and highly recommended for hobby coders as well. The basic functionality can be utilized very quickly, utilizing the full capability of git will probably take many years if ever.

## Meta information
### Purpose
This document aims to be a shallow but extensive list of resources related to development, maintenance and use of computer related things such as software, peripherals, hardware, etc. Since this document is meant to complement the _tech_n_programming_ channel on the _Social Anxiety (SA) server_ at _Discord_, the scope of topics that are suitable for this list should mirror the scope of the _SA_ channel. 

### How to contribute
There are two ways you can contribute to this document:
 - (**Easy**) Ask in the channel and someone else can help you add whatever if applicable
 - (**Hard**) Read the contribution guide and get shit done the only way you know
 
The [contribution guide](https://github.com/SirDoor/sapr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md) shall contain information about the conventions and format of this document, the general idea should be this:


>Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime

Prefer resources that encourage fundamental understanding rather than for example "useful code snippets" or similar.
